Initially In our research-paper-experiments, five-set of datasets, containing 4.2K and 51K Urdu-text-embedded synthetic images were generated using the CLE annotation text to evaluate different tasks of detection, orientation prediction, and recognition of ligatures. These synthetic images contain 132, and 1600 unique ligatures corresponding to 4.2K and 51K images respectively, with 32 variations of each ligature (4-backgrounds and font 8-color variations). 

--->>> The Given dataset here is most similar to dataset we used in our exmperiments. The images with its name contain annotation both in terms of Urdu-text, its location and orientation information. From given annotation, sub-datasets for given tasks like Urdu-Text-detection, Urdu-Text-orientation-prediction and Urdu-Text-ligature-recognition can be performed.


--->>> Realworld Urdu outdoor-text dataset "UrText" will be shared soon ...
